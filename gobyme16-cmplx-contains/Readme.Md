** Assertions **
Basic Assertions: Basic assertion functions like assert.Equal, assert.NotEqual, assert.Nil, assert.NotNil, assert.True, and assert.False. These are fundamental for validating test conditions.

Error Handling Assertions: Understand the use of assert.Error and assert.NoError for checking the presence or absence of errors.

Complex Assertions: Explore assertions for more complex scenarios, like assert.Contains, assert.Len, and assert.Regexp.

Comparisons Assertions: comparison assertions like assert.Greater, assert.Less, and assert.WithinRange
